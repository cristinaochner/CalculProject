# CalculProject

CalculProject is an Android application which can parse and execute suffix, infix and postfix Expressions.
Infix expression are the normal expression commonly used where the operator is placed between operands:
```
 3  *  2  +  5  *  3 
 6  +  15 
 21
```
Postfix expression notation is commonly called RPN "Reverse Polish Notation". In this notation the operator is placed after the operands:
```
 3  2  *  5  3  *  +
 6  5  3  *  +
 6 15  +
 21
 ```
Prefix expression notation is just the reverse of RPN
